# Q-Learning Demo
![picture](img/wall-e.jpeg)
> This is a demo of Q-learning algorithm for the [introduction story about Reinforcement Learning on Medium](https://medium.com). The algorithm is implemented here via tabular and approximate solutions, **table** and **neural net** (ANN) solutions respectively. The code for it is written in **Python** as the _prototyping environment_ with **MXNet** as the _machine learning framework_ and **OpenAI Gym** as the _model environment for reinforcement learning_.

## Instructions
Follow these steps to run the demo:
1. download this repository,
2. activate your Python environment, e.g. get into your virtual environment from your command-line interface,
3. start the Jupyter Notebook interface by typing the following command,
```
jupyter notebook
```
4. navigate to the downloaded repository,
5. and open the included notebooks (_ipynb_ files).

## Requirements
Install the following packages for your Python 3.6+ environment.
* Jupyter Notebook 1+
* Matplotlib 2.2+
* MXNet 1.2+
* OpenAI Gym 0.10+
